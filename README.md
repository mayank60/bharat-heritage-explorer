2. [x] **Interactive Leaflet Map**: Click any state polygon to verify saffron highlight, auto-zoom to bounds, and panel activation.
3. [x] **State Detail Panel**: Inspect all 7 tabs (Overview, Culture, Festivals, Food, Languages, Monuments, Art & Crafts) for loaded state data.
4. [x] **Marker Clustering & Pins**: Verify heritage site pins render at exact coordinates with interactive info popups.
5. [x] **Map Layer Switcher**: Toggle between Street View (OSM), Topographic Terrain, and Carto Light.
